    <p class="about">Resonance Collective is a tight-knit group DJ’s, music producers and promoters operating night and day on unceded Lək̓ʷəŋən Territories. Initially conceived in 2021 as a channel to throw parties their way, they combated a noted lack of diversity and representation within the local dance music scene in Victoria by throwing gender & genre diverse dance music events with a focus on quality of sound, artistic integrity, support for emerging artists & community safety. Three years later, recently incorporated as a non-profit, Resonance Collective continues to weave and nurture a mycelic web of underground connections in the city.</p>
